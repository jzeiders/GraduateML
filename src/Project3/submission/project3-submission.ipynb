    "# Sentiment Classification Model Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Overview\n",
    "The implementation uses a Logistic Regression model with carefully tuned hyperparameters for sentiment classification. Here are the key technical aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- Features are preprocessed by dropping the 'id' and 'review' columns, retaining only the numerical feature columns\n",
    "- The target variable 'sentiment' is separated from the features\n",
    "- Data is loaded using Polars for efficient memory management and fast I/O operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture\n",
    "- Algorithm: Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Solver: 'liblinear' (efficient for smaller datasets)\n",
    "- Hyperparameters:\n",
    "  - C=10 (inverse of regularization strength)\n",
    "  - max_iter=1000 (maximum iterations for convergence)\n",
    "  - random_state=42 (for reproducibility)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Process\n",
    "- The model is trained independently on 5 different data splits\n",
    "- Each split's training process is isolated to ensure proper validation\n",
    "- Grid search capability is included but not used in the final results (configured for C values: [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100])\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed breakdown of the performance across all splits:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Split | AUC Score | Training Time (s) | Inference Time (s) |\n",
    "|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| 1     | 0.987113  | 6.27             | 0.10             |\n",
